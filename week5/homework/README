
* HOMEWORK 1 - Write a Python script does the following:
(1) Create a class called: ComplexNumber.
This class will have two attributes:

	real
	imag
	
(2) The class: ComplexNumber also should have a method called:

	getData()

It returns the REAL and IMAG part of the ComplexNumber

(3) Using __init__() function to create a class constructor for ComplexNumber
The constructor will take two parameters: real, imag
ONE IMPORTANT requirement:
The constructor has to have the default values of 0 for both "real" and "imag" attribute.
This means when the object is created:

 	myComplexNumber = ComplexNumber()
 
myComplexNumber's real and imag attribute will be set to 0

(4) Instantiate couple of ComplexNumber class objects. Use the getData() method to 
print out the results.

(5) Question: can we add the additional attributes to the class/object once the
object is created? For example, something about the following two lines:

	temp = ComplexNumber(5)
	temp.attr = 10


* HOMEWORK 2 - Write a Python script that will 

(1) Convert a list of temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Store the result into a new list called "convertedFromF"
To convert temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 and multiply by .5556 (or 5/9).

    Example: (50°F - 32) x .5556 = 10°C

(2) Convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Store the result into a new list called "convertedFromF"
To convert temperatures in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 1.8 (or 9/5) and add 32.

    Example: 30°C x 1.8 + 32 = 86°F

(3) Create a new list from the resulted F to C conversion

(4) Create a new list from the resulted C to F conversion

(5) Using Python "filter" to filter out the Fahrenheit temperatures that is higher than 90 and lower than 40.
Store the result in a new list.

(6) Using Python "filter" to filter out the Celsius temperatures that is higher than 30 and lower than 15
Store the result in a new list.
