****** Homework 1, Python List Comprehension:

	(1) Split the following phrase into each individual word. 
	
	'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
	
	Store the result words in a variable called: "WORDS". 
	Please note that the variable "WORDS" is a Python list data type.
	
	(2) Do the following operation to each WORDS into: 
		Convert it to upper case, 
		Convert it to lower case 
		Calculate length of the word.
		
		Create a list to store the result of the above operation. For example,
		if the word is: "Hello", you should create a list as: ["HELLO", "hello", 5].
		
	(3) Use the results of (2) to create a list which holds all the "word list". 
	For example: 
		If the phrase is: "Hello World", then the final result should be:
		[["HELLO", "hello", 5],["WORLD", "world", 5]]
		

****** Homework 2, Check the variable for data type before print it out:

	(1) Use the following list:
	
	["Hello", 1, "World!", 345, "My height", 5.11]
	
	(2) Write a Pythin script to print out all the items in the list correctly. The result should be:
	
		Hello
		1
		World
		345
		My height
		5.11

****** Homework 3, Python Dictionary example - write a script that does the following:

(1) Define empty dictionary called "ages".
(2) Add the following "key-value" pair into the above dictionary:
so the result would like this:
	ages = { 'Sue' : 23,
			'Peter': 19,
			'Andrew': 78,
			'Karren':45	}
(3) Use the function has_key() on dictionary "ages" - This function takes this form:
	function_name.has_key(key-name)
		It returns TRUE if the dictionary has key-name in it
		but returns FALSE if it doesn't.
	Please note that this is how 'if' statements work - they run if something is true
	and they don't when something is false.
(4) Use the function keys() on dictionary "ages" to print all the keys in the dictionary
 	- This function returns a list of all the names of the keys.
(5) Use the function values() on dictionary "ages" to print all the values in the dictionary 
	- This function returns all the values in a dictionary.
(6) Use the function sort() on dictionary "ages" to sort dictionary items based on the values and print the result out. 
	- The sort() function will sort all values in a list alphabetically, numerically, etc...
(7) Use the len() function to find out how many items in the dictionary "ages". Print the result out.
