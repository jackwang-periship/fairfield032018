Write a Python script that will:

(1) Takes ONE command line parameter. For example:
	
	week2homework.py myfilename
	
	where "week2homework.py" is the name of the homework script and "myfilename" is the command line parameter that
	we are passing into the script.

(8) Print what you have "read".
(9) Use a well know Python lib to download the file specified by the "DownloadUR"L
